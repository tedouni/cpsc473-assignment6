CPSC 473 - Web Front-End Engineering for Internet Applications
Assignment 6 - Spring 2017
Section 2 due March 13.  Section 1 due March 15.
In this assignment, you will work through Chapters 9 and 10 of the textbook and complete some programming challenges.
Complete the following:
Work through Chapter 9 to add Bootstrap to CoffeeRun and create an order form.
Work through Chapter 10 to add jQuery to CoffeeRun and create a FormHandler object.
Complete the Bronze Challenge: Supersize It.
Complete the Silver Challenge: Showing the Value as the Slider Changes, including the extra challenge to change the color to reflect the intensity of the caffeine strength.
Complete the Gold Challenge: Adding Achievements.

Note that to really implement a feature like this you’d need to be able to store and retrieve email addresses and achievements from a server.  For now, once the achievement has been unlocked, you should remember the e-mail addresss until the page is reloaded.
Push the contents of your coffeerun directory into a new public GitHub repository.
